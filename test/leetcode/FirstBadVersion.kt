 *
 * 278. First Bad Version
 * [Easy]
 *
 * ou are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product.
 * Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check.
 * Since each version is developed based on the previous version,
 * all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
 *
 * Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first
 * bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
 *
 * You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad.
 * Implement a function to find the first bad version.
 * You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= bad <= n <= 2^31 - 1
