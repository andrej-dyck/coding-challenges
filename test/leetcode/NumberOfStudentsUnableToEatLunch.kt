/**

 *
 * 1700. Number of Students Unable to Eat Lunch
 * [Easy]
 *
 * The school cafeteria offers circular and square sandwiches at lunch break, referred to by numbers 0 and 1 respectively.
 * All students stand in a queue. Each student either prefers square or circular sandwiches.
 *
 * The number of sandwiches in the cafeteria is equal to the number of students. The sandwiches are placed in a stack. At each step:
 * - If the student at the front of the queue prefers the sandwich on the top of the stack, they will take it and leave the queue.
 * - Otherwise, they will leave it and go to the queue's end.
 *
 * This continues until none of the queue students want to take the top sandwich and are thus unable to eat.
 *
 * You are given two integer arrays students and sandwiches where sandwiches[i] is the type of the i-th sandwich
 * in the stack (i = 0 is the top of the stack) and students[j] is the preference of the j-th student
 * in the initial queue (j = 0 is the front of the queue). Return the number of students that are unable to eat.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= students.length, sandwiches.length <= 100
 * - students.length == sandwiches.length
 * - sandwiches[i] is 0 or 1.
 * - students[i] is 0 or 1.
