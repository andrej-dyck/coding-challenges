 *
 * 771. Jewels and Stones
 * [Easy]
 *
 * You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have.
 * Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
 *
 * Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
 * - jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
 * - All the characters of jewels are unique.
