 * 1816. Truncate Sentence
 * [Easy]
 *
 * A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.
 * Each of the words consists of only uppercase and lowercase English letters (no punctuation).
 *
 * For example, "Hello World", "HELLO", and "hello world hello world" are all sentences.
 *
 * You are given a sentence s and an integer k. You want to truncate s such that
 * it contains only the first k words. Return s after truncating it.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= s.length <= 500
 * - k is in the range [1, the number of words in s].
 * - s consist of only lowercase and uppercase English letters and spaces.
 * - The words in s are separated by a single space.
 * - There are no leading or trailing spaces.
